# Filterablelist

This is a filterable list made with plain JavaScript and Materialize CSS for the frontend User Interface. I was able to put this together with the help of a video tutorial titled "Build a Filterable List With Vanilla JavaScript" by Traversy Media on youtube.
It consists of only 1 file, the index.html file. One can gain access to the Filterable List by opening the file with a web browser.
